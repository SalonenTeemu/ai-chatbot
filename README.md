# ai-chatbot

This is a simple AI chatbot implemented with Google Gemini API using the 2.0 Flash model. You can type messages and it will answer them. It was interesting to test how AI can be used in web development. **Remember to not share any personal information with the chatbot.**

## Running the application

The application can be tested on my [homepage](https://salonenteemu.fi/projects/ai-chatbot-app) as it is one of the projects there.

A Gemini API key can be retrieved from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) if you want to test this version of the application by setting the key as an environment variable.
